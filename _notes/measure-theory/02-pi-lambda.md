# Section 2: The Monotone Class Theorem and the $\pi$-$\lambda$ Theorem

## Monotone Sequences of Sets
A sequence $(A_n)$ is said to be **(monotone) increasing** if 

$$A_1 \subset A_2 \subset A_3 \subset \cdots$$

The limit of an increasing sequence is denoted $A_n \nearrow A$ where

$$A = \bigcup_{n\in \N} A_n$$

A sequence $(A_n)$ is said to be **(monotone) decreasing** if 

$$A_1 \supset A_2 \supset A_3 \supset \cdots$$

The limit of an decreasing sequence is denoted $A_n \searrow A$ where

$$A = \bigcap_{n\in \N} A_n$$

Monotone sequences of sets play an important role in measure theory because many limiting operations are expressed in terms of increasing unions and decreasing intersections.

## Proposition 2.1: Set Approximation in Metric Spaces
In a metric space $(X,d)$, any open set is the limit of an increasing sequence of closed sets i.e open sets are in $F_{\sigma}$.
Moreover, any closed set is the limit of a decreasing sequence of open sets i.e. closed sets are in $G_{\delta}$.

### Proof.
Let $U$ be an open set in the metric space $(X,d)$. 
Define a sequence of closed sets $(U_n)$ such that

$$U_n \coloneqq \big\{x: d(x,U^c) \ge 1/n\big\}$$

By definition, $U_n \subset U$ for all $n \in \N$, so $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} U_n \subset U$.
Furthermore, because $U$ is an open set in a metric space, for each $x \in U$ $d(x,U^c) >0$. Pick $n$ large enough so $1/n < d(x,U^c)$, hence $x \in U_n$. 
We conclude $U_n \nearrow U$.

On the other hand, let $C$ be a closed set in a metric space $(X,d)$.
Define a sequence of open sets $(C_n)$ such that

$$C_n = \big\{x: d(x,C) < 1/n\big\}$$

A similar argument shows that $C_n \searrow C$. $\blacksquare$

This lemma illustrates an important general principle: complicated sets can often be approximated by monotone limits of simpler sets. This idea appears repeatedly in measure theory and integration.

## Monotone Classes
In Riemann integration, sets are approximated by limits of unions of rectangles.
In the Darboux formulation, the lower integral is obtained from a monotone increasing sequence of rectangle unions, while the upper integral is obtained from a monotone decreasing sequence.

Measure theory generalizes this philosophy: we study complicated sets by approximating them through monotone limits of simpler sets.
Because of this, many proofs in measure theory follow a common pattern:

1. prove a property for a simple family of sets,
2. show the property is preserved under monotone limits,
3. extend the property to a much larger collection of sets.

A family of subsets of $\Omega$ is called a **monotone class** $\mathcal{M}$ if the limit of any monotone sequence of sets is contained in the family. More precisely,
- if $(A_n) \in \mathcal{M}$ is monotone increasing and $A_n \nearrow A$, then $A \in \mathcal{M}$
- if $(A_n) \in \mathcal{M}$ is monotone decreasing and $A_n \searrow A$, then $A \in \mathcal{M}$

## Lemma 2.2: Intersection of Monotone Classes
Let $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$ be monotone classes. Then, $\mathcal{M}_1 \cap \mathcal{M}_2$ is a monotone class.

The proof of the previous lemma is straightforward and left as an exercise. 
Moreover, the proof can be reformulated in terms of arbitrary intersections.
Similar to $\sigma$-algebras, we can consider the monotone classes generated by a family of sets.
More precisely, the monotone class generated by $\mathcal{A}$, denoted $M(\mathcal{A})$, is the intersection of all monotone classes containing $\mathcal{A}$ as a subset.

## $\sigma$-algebras and Monotone Classes
Because $\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable unions and countable intersections, it follows that every $\sigma$-algebra is a monotone class. 
The converse is not true in general. Moreover, monotone classes are oftentimes easier to verify and simpler to analyze. In measure theory, a common proof strategy is:
1. Define a class of sets that have a specific property
2. Show that the class of sets is a monotone class
3. Verify that the monotone class contains a simpler family (e.g. an algebra of sets)
4. Conclude that the monotone class contains the $\sigma$-algebra generate by the simpler family.

The fourth step is justified by the following theorem:

## Monotone Class Theorem
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an algebra of subsets of $\Omega$. Then, $\sigma(\mathcal{A}) = M(\mathcal{A})$.

### Proof.
Since we know that any $\sigma$-algebra is a monotone class, we have $M(\mathcal{A}) \subset \sigma(\mathcal{A})$. 
It suffices to show that $\mathcal{M} \coloneqq M(\mathcal{A})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.
Since $\mathcal{M}$ is a monotone class, we know that it is closed under the union of increasing sequences of sets and closed under the intersection of decreasing sequences of sets.
However, we do not know if it is yet closed under union and intersection in general.
We will bootstrap from knowing $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under finite intersections to proving $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under finite intersections, then complements, then countable unions.
To this end, we first define
$$\mathcal{M}_E = \{B \subset \Omega:E \cap B \in \mathcal{M}\}$$
where $E \in \mathcal{M}$ is fixed.

#### Claim 1: $\mathcal{M}_E$ is a monotone class.

Let $(B_n)$ be an increasing sequence in $\mathcal{M}_E$ where $B_n \nearrow B$.
Hence, $(E \cap B_n)$ is an increasing sequence in $\mathcal{M}$. 
Since $\mathcal{M}$ is a monotone class, it follows that
$$E \cap B = E \cap \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}E \cap B_n \in \mathcal{M}$$
Therefore, $B \in \mathcal{M}_E$. An identical argument shows that $\mathcal{M}_E$ is closed under limits of a decreasing sequences of sets. Thus, $\mathcal{M}_E$ is a monotone class. 
$\square$

#### Claim 2: If $E \in \mathcal{A}$ then $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}_E$

Let $A \in \mathcal{A}$.
Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra of sets, it is closed under finite intersections.
Hence, $A \cap E \in \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}$.
Therefore, $A \in \mathcal{M}_E$. 
$\square$

By Claim 1 and Claim 2, for every fixed $A \in \mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{M}_A$ is a monotone class containing $\mathcal{A}$. 
Hence, 
$$\mathcal{M} = M(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{M}_A$$
In particular, for any $B \in \mathcal{M}$, $A \cap B \in \mathcal{M}$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under intersection with any element of $\mathcal{A}$. 
Next, we want to show that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under intersection in general.

#### Claim 3: $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under finite intersections
Fix $B \in \mathcal{M}$.
By Claim 1, $\mathcal{M}_B$ is a monotone class.
Since we have just shown that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under intersections with elements of $\mathcal{A}$, we have $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}_B$. 
Since $\mathcal{M}_B$ is a monotone class containing $\mathcal{A}$, we have
$$\mathcal{M} = M(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{M}_B$$
In particular, for any $C \in \mathcal{M}$, $B \cap C \in \mathcal{M}$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under intersection. $\square$

Next, we must show that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under complements. To this end, we will define
$$\mathcal{C} \coloneqq \{E \subset \Omega: E^c \in \mathcal{M}\}$$

#### Claim 4: $\mathcal{C}$ is a monotone class containing $\mathcal{A}$
Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra, $A \in \mathcal{A}$ implies $A^c \in \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}$.
Hence, $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{C}$. 
Next, we will show that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under monotone limits.
Let $(E_n)$ be an increasing sequence of sets in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $E_n \nearrow E$.
By DeMorgan's laws, $E_n^c \searrow E^c$. By definition of $\mathcal{C}$, $(E_n^c)$ is a decreasing sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$. 
Since $\mathcal{M}$ is a monotone class, $E^c \in \mathcal{M}$. 
Hence, $E \in \mathcal{C}$. A similar argument shows that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under limits of monotone decreasing sequences of sets. 
Thus, $\mathcal{C}$ is a monotone class. $\square$

By Claim 4, $\mathcal{M} = M(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{C}$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under complements. 
So far, we have shown that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under finite intersections and complements. 
By DeMorgan's laws, $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under finite unions.
To complete the proof we must show that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under countable unions.

#### Claim 5: $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under countable unions
Let $(A_n)$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$.
Since $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under finite unions, the sequence $(B_n)$ where
$$B_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_n$$
is a monotone increasing sequence in $\mathcal{M}$.
Since $B_n \nearrow \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ and $\mathcal{M}$ is a monotone class, the union lies in $\mathcal{M}$.
Thus, $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under countable unions. $\square$

Thus, $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under complements and countable unions. Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra of sets, $\Omega \in \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}$. Thus, $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. $\blacksquare$

## From Monotone Classes to the $\pi$-$\lambda$ Reformulation

The monotone class theorem is favored by analysts. It follows the analytic philosophy of using *simpler* sets as approximations of more complicated sets. This formalism is particularly useful in integration theory, where measurable functions are approximated by simple functions. Other important situations in which the monotone class theorem plays a central role include

- Constructing measures  
- Extending properties of functions  
- Approximating measurable functions  
- Proving results about integrals  

Conceptually, the monotone class theorem is an **approximation principle**: complicated objects are obtained as limits of simpler ones.

However, in many applications, especially in probability theory, the monotone class formalism can be unwieldy to apply directly, since it typically begins with an algebra of sets. In the mid-twentieth century, Dynkin introduced a different formalism, now called the $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem, which is especially well suited to probabilistic arguments.

Rather than emphasizing approximation, the $\pi$-$\lambda$ formalism emphasizes **logical closure**. Dynkin separated the basic closure properties of a $\sigma$-algebra into two simpler structures:

- $\pi$-systems, which are closed under finite intersections  
- $\lambda$-systems, which are closed under complements and countable disjoint unions  

A key observation is that any collection of sets that is both a $\pi$-system and a $\lambda$-system is automatically a $\sigma$-algebra. This allows one to verify properties on a small generating $\pi$-system and extend them to the entire $\sigma$-algebra using the $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem. Conceptually, the $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem is an **equality principle**: once two measures (or probabilities) agree on a generating $\pi$-system, they agree on the whole $\sigma$-algebra.

Although the monotone class theorem and the $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem are equivalent in logical strength, the $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem is particularly effective for

- Proving uniqueness of measures  
- Showing two measures coincide  
- Verifying independence of random variables  
- Checking equality of distributions  

The rest of this section will focus on developing the $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem.

## Examples of $\pi$-Systems

Recall that a $\pi$-system is a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of a set $X$ that is closed under finite intersections: if $A,B \in \mathcal{P}$, then $A \cap B \in \mathcal{P}$.

Many of the most common generating families in measure theory and probability theory are naturally $\pi$-systems. We record several important examples.
- The collection of half-open intervals on $\R$.
- The collection of half-open rectangles on $\R^n$.
- The collection of cylinder sets on $\Omega^{\N}$. 

## Lemma 2.3: Intersections of $\pi$-systems
Let $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ be $\pi$-systems. Then, $\mathcal{P}_1 \cap \mathcal{P}_2$ is a $\pi$-system.

The proof of Lemma 2.3 is routine and left as an exercise. Similar to algebras, $\sigma$-algebras, and monotone classes, we can define the $\pi$-system generated by a set. More precisely, if $\mathcal{S}$ is a family of sets on the space $\Omega$, we define $\pi(\mathcal{S})$ to be the intersection of all $\pi$-systems on $\Omega$ that contain $\mathcal{S}$. Lemma 2.3 guarantees that the $\pi$-system generated by a set is well defined.

An equivalent, more constructive, definition of a $\pi$-system generated by a set is given by
$$\pi(\mathcal{S}) = \left\{\bigcap_{i=1}^n S_i: S_1,\dots,S_n \in \mathcal{S}\right\}$$
i.e. the set of all finite intersections of elements in $\mathcal{S}$.

## Lemma 2.4: Product of $\pi$-systems
Let $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ be $\pi$-systems. Then, $\mathcal{P}_1 \times \mathcal{P}_2$ is a $\pi$-system.

Lemma 2.4 can be proved by using the set identity
$$(A \times B) \cap (C \times D) = (A \cap C) \times (B \cap D)$$

## Lemma 2.5: Pre-images of $\pi$-systems are $\pi$-systems
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a $\pi$-system on the space $Y$. If $f:X \to Y$ is a function, then
$$f^{-1}(\mathcal{P}) = \{ f^{-1}(A) : A \in \mathcal{P} \} $$
is a $\pi$-system.

### Proof.
Let $A,B \in f^{-1}(\mathcal{P})$. Then, there exist $C,D \in \mathcal{P}$ such that $A = f^{-1}(C)$ and $B = f^{-1}(D)$. Using the set identity
$$f^{-1}(C \cap D) = f^{-1}(C) \cap f^{-1}(D)$$
we see that $A \cap B \in f^{-1}(\mathcal{P})$.
$\square$

Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.5 can be used to show that half-open rectangles and cylinder sets are $\pi$-systems. Lemma 2.5 is needed since cylinder sets may be realized as pre-images of rectangles under coordinate projection maps.

Although $\pi$-systems capture stability under intersections, they do not, in general, enjoy closure under complements or unions. To develop a framework capable of extending properties from a generating $\pi$-system to an entire $\sigma$-algebra, we now introduce $\lambda$-systems, which emphasize closure under complements and countable disjoint unions.

## $\lambda$-systems (Dynkin Systems)
A **$\lambda$-system** on a space $\Omega$ is a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ such that
- $\Omega \in \mathcal{D}$
- $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under complements
- $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under countable pairwise disjoint unions.

We will explore concrete examples of $\lambda$-systems after introducing measures. 

As with $\pi$-systems, $\sigma$-algebras, and monotone classes, one may define the $\lambda$-system generated by a collection of sets. If $\mathcal{S}$ is a family of subsets of $\Omega$, we denote by $\lambda(\mathcal{S})$ the smallest $\lambda$-system containing $\mathcal{S}$. By “smallest,” we mean

$$
\lambda(\mathcal{S})
=
\bigcap \{ \mathcal{D} : \mathcal{D} \text{ is a $\lambda$-system and } \mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{D} \}.
$$

This definition is well posed because arbitrary intersections of $\lambda$-systems are again $\lambda$-systems (the verification is straightforward and left as an exercise).

## Proposition 2.6: $\lambda$-systems are Monotone Classes
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a $\lambda$-system on the space $\Omega$. Then, $\mathcal{D}$ is a monotone class.

### Proof.
Let $(A_n)$ be an increasing sequence of sets in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $A_n \nearrow A$.
Define a new sequence $(B_n)$ such that
$$B_1 = A_1,\quad B_n = A_n\setminus A_{n-1}\, \text{ for $n >1$}$$
Since $A_{n-1} \subset A_n$, the sets $A_n^c$ and $A_{n-1}$ are disjoint.
From the set identity
$$A_n \setminus A_{n-1} = (A_n^c \sqcup A_{n-1})^c$$
and the fact that $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under complements and disjoint unions, we conclude that $B_n \in \mathcal{D}$ for every $n$.
Since $A = \bigsqcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n$, closure under countable disjoint unions in $\mathcal{D}$ implies $A \in \mathcal{D}$.
Thus, $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under limits of increasing sequences. 

To show that $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under limits of decreasing sequences, let $(A_n)$ be a decreasing sequence of sets in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $A_n \searrow A$.
Since $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under complements, $(A_n^c)$ is an increasing sequence of sets in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $A_n^c \nearrow A^c$.
Since we have already shown that $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under monotone increasing limits, $A^c \in \mathcal{D}$. 
By closure under complements, $A \in \mathcal{D}$. 
This shows that $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under limits of decreasing sequences. 
$\blacksquare$

It is important to note that all $\sigma$-algebras are also $\lambda$-systems. In this sense
$$\sigma\text{-algebras} \subset \lambda\text{-systems} \subset \text{monotone classes}$$
By combining $\pi$-systems and $\lambda$-systems, we realize Dynkin's goal of characterizing $\sigma$-algebras.

## Lemma 2.7: $\pi$-system + $\lambda$-system = $\sigma$-algebra
Suppose that $\mathcal{S}$ is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ that is a $\pi$-system and $\lambda$-systems. Then, $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

### Proof.
We need to check the three properties of a $\sigma$-algebra.
1. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\lambda$-system, $\Omega \in \mathcal{S}$.
2. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\lambda$-system, $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under complements.
3. Let $A,B \in \mathcal{S}$.
Observe that $A \cup B = (A^c \cap B^c)^c$.
Since $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under complements $A^c,B^c \in \mathcal{S}$. 
Since $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\pi$-system, $A^c \cap B^c \in \mathcal{S}$,
Thus, $A \cup B = (A^c \cap B^c)^c \in \mathcal{S}$. 
This argument can be extended to show that $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under finite unions. 
Moreover, the set identity $A \setminus B = A \cap B^c$ shows that $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under relative complements. 
To show that $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under countable unions, let $(A_n)$ be a sequence of sets. 
Define a new sequence $(B_n)$ where $B_1 = A_1$ and $B_n = A_n \setminus \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i\right)$. 
Since $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under finite unions and relative complements $B_n \in \mathcal{S}$ for each $n \in \N$.
By construction
$$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n = \bigsqcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \in \mathcal{S}$$
Thus, $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.
$\blacksquare$

The preceding proposition shows that a collection of sets that is simultaneously a $\pi$-system and a $\lambda$-system must be a $\sigma$-algebra. Thus, to prove that a property verified on a generating $\pi$-system extends to the entire $\sigma$-algebra it generates, it suffices to construct a suitable $\lambda$-system containing that $\pi$-system and then show that it is also closed under intersections.

The $\pi$-$\lambda$ theorem accomplishes precisely this. It provides a powerful criterion for extending properties from a $\pi$-system to the $\sigma$-algebra it generates and forms the foundation for many uniqueness and independence results in probability theory.


## $\pi$-$\lambda$ Theorem (Sierpinski-Dynkin, 1928)
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a $\pi$-system on the space $\Omega$. Then,
$$\sigma(\mathcal{P}) = \lambda(\mathcal{P})$$

### Proof.
Any $\sigma$-algebra is automatically a $\lambda$-system, so
$$\lambda(\mathcal{P}) \subset \sigma(\mathcal{P})$$
To show the opposite inclusion, it suffices to show that $\lambda(\mathcal{P})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{P}$.
Let $\mathcal{D} = \lambda(\mathcal{P})$. Our goal will be to show that $\mathcal{D}$ is a $\pi$-system and then apply Lemma 2.7.
To this end, define
$$\mathcal{D}_A = \{B \subset \Omega: A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}\}$$
where $A$ is a fixed subset of $\Omega$.

#### Claim 1: If $A \in \mathcal{P}$, then $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathcal{D}_A$
Let $B \in \mathcal{P}$. Since $\mathcal{P}$ is a $\pi$-system $A \cap B \in \mathcal{P}$. Hence, $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathcal{D}_A$. 
$\square$

#### Claim 2: If $A \in \mathcal{D}$, then $\mathcal{D}_A$ is a $\lambda$-system
Since $A \cap \Omega = A \in \mathcal{D}$, $\Omega \in \mathcal{D}_A$.
Next, we will show that $\mathcal{D}_A$ is closed under complements.
Let $B \in \mathcal{D}_A$, so $A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}$. 
Since $\mathcal{D}$ is a $\lambda$-system, it is closed under complements, so $A^c \in \mathcal{D}$. 
Consider the set identity
$$A \cap B^c = A \setminus B = A \setminus (A \cap B)$$
Moreover,
$$A \setminus (A\cap B) = A \cap (A\cap B)^c = (A^c \cup (A \cap B))^c$$
Because $A \cap B \subset A$, the sets $A^c$ and $A \cap B$ are disjoint.
Therefore,
$$A \cap B^c = (A^c \sqcup (A \cap B))^c$$
The right hand side consists of elements in $\mathcal{D}$ combined using only the operations of disjoint union and complements. 
Hence, $A \cap B^c \in \mathcal{D}$ and $B^c \in \mathcal{D}_A$. 
Thus, $\mathcal{D}_A$ is closed under complements. 
To show that $\mathcal{D}_A$ is closed under countable pairwise disjoint unions, suppose that $(B_n)$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathcal{D}_A$.
By definition, $A \cap B_n \in \mathcal{D}$ for all $n \in \N$.
Using the distributive property of intersection over unions
$$A \cap \left(\bigsqcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \right) = \bigsqcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (A \cap B_n)$$
The right hand side of the equality is an element of $\mathcal{D}$ by the closure properties of $\lambda$-systems.
Therefore, $\mathcal{D}_A$ is closed under pairwise disjoint countable unions. 
Thus, $\mathcal{D}_A$ is a $\lambda$-system.
$\square$

By Claim 1 and Claim 2, for each fixed $A \in \mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{D}_A$ is a $\lambda$-system containing $\mathcal{P}$.
By the definition of $\lambda(\mathcal{P})$, we have
$$\mathcal{D} = \lambda(\mathcal{P}) \subset \mathcal{D}_A$$
In other words, $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under intersection of elements in $\mathcal{D}$ with elements in $\mathcal{P}$. We now show that the intersection-closure with $\mathcal{P}$ can be extended to intersection-closure with all of $\mathcal{D}$.

#### Claim 3: $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under intersection.
Let $A \in \mathcal{D}$ and $B \in \mathcal{P}$. 
Since $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under intersection of elements in $\mathcal{D}$ with elements in $\mathcal{P}$, $A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}$.
Hence, $B \in \mathcal{D}_A$. Since $B \in \mathcal{P}$ was arbitrary, we conclude $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathcal{D}_A$.
By Claim 2, $D_A$ is a $\lambda$-system.
Since, $\mathcal{D}_A$ is a $\lambda$-system containing $\mathcal{P}$, we have
$$\mathcal{D} = \lambda(\mathcal{P}) \subset \mathcal{D}_A$$
Hence, $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under intersections with the element $A$. 
Since $A \in \mathcal{D}$, was arbitrary it follows that $\mathcal{D}$ is closed under intersections.
$\square$

By Claim 3, $\mathcal{D} = \lambda(\mathcal{P})$ is a $\pi$-system.
$\lambda(\mathcal{P})$ is a $\pi$-system and a $\lambda$-system, so Lemma 2.7 implies $\lambda(\mathcal{P})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. 
Since $\lambda(\mathcal{P})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{P}$, we have
$$\sigma(\mathcal{P}) \subset \lambda(\mathcal{P})$$
Combining the inclusions, yields the proof.
$\blacksquare$

The $\pi$–$\lambda$ theorem is one of the main engines behind uniqueness: if two measures agree on a generating $\pi$-system, they agree everywhere.
In the next section, we turn to the complementary problem: existence—how to construct measures from simple geometric data. 
Caratheodory’s construction provides the existence mechanism, and $\pi$–$\lambda$ provides the uniqueness mechanism.
