## About Me
I am a graduate student at California State University Los Angeles (CSULA) pursuing a Master's Degree in mathematics. I serve as the Math Gym Coordinator at CSULA which supports the Precalculus and Calculus Class sequences. I have also taught the Precalculus classes, Math 1081 and Math 1085, at CSULA. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Stanford University in 2020.

## Research
My research interests are in combinatorics. In particular, I like to study hypergraphs, extremal combinatorics, and algebraic combinatorics. Recently, I have been focusing on the Erd≈ës Box Problem, Odd Covers of Hypergraphs, and the Union-Closed Sets Conjecture under the tutelage of Jason O'neill at CSULA.
