# A Rant About High School Math

Working as a math tutor for over a decade, I am often asked about my math background. Parents often ask this question right before I begin tutoring their child. I usually reply that I was a math major at some prestigious university in order to quell thier fears. The parents will then chat about their experience with math in high school. Some parents talk about the their trauma from high school mathematics. Others complain about math being easy until Calculus. A few even boast about how they never took a math class again after high school. (Please do not say these things right before I help your child not fail their math class.)



>I was really good at math until high school. Then,

What is the difference between Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus
Why are calculus students bad at algebra?
Why do we do proofs only in geometry?
