# Jonathan Davidson

I am a mathematician interested in **analysis and combinatorics**.  
My research centers on **transforming discrete objects into continuous objects in order to study combinatorial optimization problems**, with graph limits serving as a guiding example. I am particularly drawn to problems in which analytic structure emerges naturally from combinatorial data.

## Background

I completed my undergraduate studies at **Stanford University**, where I worked on problems related to **minimal and capillary surfaces**, studying how geometric boundary conditions can produce singular behavior in the resulting variational surfaces.

I completed my master’s degree at **California State University, Los Angeles**, where I conducted research in extremal combinatorics, including work on:

- The chromatic number of Abelian Cayley graphs  
- The multicolored Erdős box problem  
- Extremal theory of product graphs  

These experiences shaped my current interest in the interaction between combinatorics and analysis.

## Current Work

I am studying the **foundational results on convergence of probability measures** in order to better understand **graph limits** and, more broadly, how discrete structures converge to continuous objects.

To support this, I am developing a self-contained set of notes on **measure theory and probability**, intended as a conceptual and technical precursor to Billingsley’s *Probability and Measure*. The emphasis is on the analytic tools underlying convergence:

- Extension and uniqueness principles  
- Convergence of measures  
- Weak convergence and tightness  

My goal is to understand these results structurally and to clarify how they support continuum limits of discrete systems and optimization problems.
