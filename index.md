# Jonathan Davidson

I am a mathematician interested in **analysis** and **combinatorics**, with a focus on problems where discrete structure gives rise to analytic phenomena. I am particularly motivated by questions of convergence: when do large finite objects admit meaningful continuum limits, and what analytic tools are required to understand them?

I am currently studying the theory of **large networks** and **graph limits** as a toy model for this transition. Ultimately, I aim to solve discrete optimization problems via analytic methods applied to the corresponding limiting combinatorial objects.

## Background

I completed my undergraduate studies at Stanford University, where I worked on problems related to minimal and capillary surfaces. I studied how geometric boundary conditions can produce singular behavior in the resulting variational surfaces.

I completed my master’s degree at California State University, Los Angeles, where I conducted research in combinatorics, including work on:

- The chromatic number of Abelian Cayley graphs  
- The multicolored Erdős box problem  
- Extremal theory of product graphs  

These experiences shaped my current interest in the interaction between combinatorics and analysis.
